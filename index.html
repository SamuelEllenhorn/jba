          <p>
            Founded in 2020, our youth basketball program is committed to
            building a strong, inclusive, and competitive community for boys and
            girls from 1st grade through high school (ages 6‚Äì16). With both boys
            and girls divisions, our teams compete in games across the Valley on
            Sundays, with practices held on weeknights. We are also working to
            bring more local games to our area to support families and fans even
            more. In addition to our league play, we are proud to offer birthday
            party and bar/bat mitzvah basketball experiences‚Äîfun, active, and
            memorable celebrations designed with kids in mind. Coming soon:
            We‚Äôre excited to launch Los Angeles‚Äô first premier Jewish summer
            basketball program, offering a unique opportunity for players to
            grow their skills in a high-level, values-driven environment. Our
            mission is to help the next generation of players reach their full
            potential‚Äîon and off the court. Whether your child is picking up a
            basketball for the first time or preparing to compete at the next
            level, our dedicated coaching staff is here to support, develop, and
            inspire them every step of the way.

            <h1>Ariel Sokol</h1>
            <p>
              Coach Ariel Sokol brings a deep passion for basketball,
              mentorship, and community to every player he coaches. Currently
              serving as the JV head coach and varsity assistant at Shalhevet
              High School, he previously spent three successful years coaching
              at YULA High School, helping shape the next generation of Jewish
              student-athletes. A proud alum of Yeshiva University, Ariel played
              both high school and college basketball, making history as the
              only player ever to win three consecutive Sarachek Tournament
              championships‚Äîa record that still stands today. He is a former
              player at both YULA and Shalhevet, giving him a unique perspective
              on what it means to grow up as a Jewish athlete. Balancing
              academics, athletics, family, and religious life isn‚Äôt easy‚Äîbut
              Ariel has lived it, and he‚Äôs dedicated to guiding young players
              through that journey. His mission is simple: to help young
              athletes build confidence, improve their skills, and grow into
              leaders on and off the court.
